# Assay targeted hERG

## Dependency
- Python 3.7.x
    - library RDKIT on docker
    - classic calculate descriptors

- R > 3.6


- From personal scripts
	- QSAR R scripts from github => https://github.com/ABorrel/QSAR-QSPR
	- Python class used to compute molecular descriptor => https://github.com/ABorrel/molecular-descriptors
	- Toolbox R => https://github.com/ABorrel/R_toolbox

## To do
- ~~Add function to merge QSAR model from undersampling~~
- SOM add descriptors significance 
- Build external dataset on chembl for active chemicals on herg


## Update
- 08-6-20: Unsupervised analysis 
- 10-6-20: Add QSAR-QSPR model builder
- 16-6-20: merge models from different machine learning
- 1-7-20: Fix error in R runner
